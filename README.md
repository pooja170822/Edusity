# React + Vite

I recently learned how to build a college or university website using React and Vite from a YouTube tutorial. The website is fully responsive and includes impressive features such as smooth scrolling in React, a slider, a pop-up video, and a functional contact form. I also used Web3Forms to seamlessly receive contact form inquiries on an email address.
